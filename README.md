#Song_Playlist_Exercise

Udemy Java course

Create a program that implements a playlist for songs.
Song information should include its name and duration.
There should be a capability to store a list of songs as an album.
The albums will be stored in an ArrayList.
Songs from different albums can be added to the playlist and will appear in the list in the order
they are added.
Once the songs have been added to the playlist, create a menu of options to:
- quit, skip forward to the next song, skip backwards to a previous song, replay the current song,
list the songs in the playlist.
  
A song must exist in an album before it can be added to the playlist (so you can only play songs that
you own).
